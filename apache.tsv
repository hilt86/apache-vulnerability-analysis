1	CVE-2019-0217	362		Bypass	2019-04-08	2019-05-13	6.0	None	Remote	Medium	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions.
2	CVE-2019-0215	284		Bypass	2019-04-08	2019-05-13	6.0	None	Remote	Medium	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.37 and 2.4.38, a bug in mod_ssl when using per-location client certificate verification with TLSv1.3 allowed a client to bypass configured access control restrictions.
3	CVE-2019-0211	264		Exec Code	2019-04-08	2019-05-17	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.
4	CVE-2019-0190	20		DoS	2019-01-30	2019-05-13	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.
5	CVE-2018-17199	384			2019-01-30	2019-05-07	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded.
6	CVE-2018-17189	400			2019-01-30	2019-05-07	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	In Apache HTTP server versions 2.4.37 and prior, by sending request bodies in a slow loris way to plain resources, the h2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server thread cleaning up that incoming data. This affects only HTTP/2 (mod_http2) connections.
7	CVE-2018-11763	20			2018-09-25	2019-04-26	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.34, by sending continuous, large SETTINGS frames a client can occupy a connection, server thread and CPU time without any connection timeout coming to effect. This affects only HTTP/2 connections. A possible mitigation is to not enable the h2 protocol.
8	CVE-2018-8011	476			2018-07-18	2018-09-27	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	By specially crafting HTTP requests, the mod_md challenge handler would dereference a NULL pointer and cause the child process to segfault. This could be used to DoS the server. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.33).
9	CVE-2018-1333	399		DoS	2018-06-18	2019-05-07	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	By specially crafting HTTP/2 requests, workers would be allocated 60 seconds longer than necessary, leading to worker exhaustion and a denial of service. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.18-2.4.30,2.4.33).
10	CVE-2018-1312	287			2018-03-26	2019-04-22	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.
11	CVE-2018-1303	125		DoS	2018-03-26	2018-11-13	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability.
12	CVE-2018-1302	476			2018-03-26	2018-10-04	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.
13	CVE-2018-1301	119		Overflow	2018-03-26	2019-04-22	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.
14	CVE-2018-1283	20			2018-03-26	2019-04-22	3.5	None	Remote	Medium	Single system	None	Partial	None	In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.
15	CVE-2017-15715	20			2018-03-26	2019-04-22	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.
16	CVE-2017-15710	787		DoS	2018-03-26	2019-04-22	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
17	CVE-2017-12171	20			2018-07-26	2018-09-21	6.4	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	A regression was found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 version of httpd 2.2.15-60, causing comments in the "Allow" and "Deny" configuration lines to be parsed incorrectly. A web administrator could unintentionally allow any client to access a restricted HTTP resource.
18	CVE-2017-9798	416			2017-09-18	2019-04-23	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
19	CVE-2017-9789	416			2017-07-13	2017-11-13	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	When under stress, closing many connections, the HTTP/2 handling code in Apache httpd 2.4.26 would sometimes access memory after it has been freed, resulting in potentially erratic behaviour.
20	CVE-2017-9788	20		DoS +Info	2017-07-13	2019-05-10	6.4	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	Partial	In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.
21	CVE-2017-7679	119		Overflow	2017-06-19	2018-06-02	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_mime can read one byte past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header.
22	CVE-2017-7668	20			2017-06-19	2018-06-02	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	The HTTP strict parsing changes added in Apache httpd 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.
23	CVE-2017-7659	476			2017-07-26	2018-06-02	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	A maliciously constructed HTTP/2 request could cause mod_http2 2.4.24, 2.4.25 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the server process.
24	CVE-2017-3169	476			2017-06-19	2018-06-02	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port.
25	CVE-2017-3167	287		Bypass	2017-06-19	2018-06-02	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed.
26	CVE-2016-8743	19		Http R.Spl.	2017-07-27	2018-04-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.
27	CVE-2016-8740	20		DoS	2016-12-05	2018-04-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The mod_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2 request.
28	CVE-2016-8612	20			2018-03-09	2019-05-10	3.3	None	Local Network	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	Apache HTTP Server mod_cluster before version httpd 2.4.23 is vulnerable to an Improper Input Validation in the protocol parsing logic in the load balancer resulting in a Segmentation Fault in the serving httpd process.
29	CVE-2016-5387	284			2016-07-18	2018-01-18	5.1	None	Remote	High	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.
30	CVE-2016-4979	284		Bypass	2016-07-06	2018-06-02	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, when mod_http2 and mod_ssl are enabled, does not properly recognize the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive for HTTP/2 request authorization, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the ability to send multiple requests over a single connection and aborting a renegotiation.
31	CVE-2016-4975	93		Http R.Spl.	2018-08-14	2018-10-19	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the "Location" or other outbound header key or value. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 (Affected 2.4.1-2.4.23). Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.32 (Affected 2.2.0-2.2.31).
32	CVE-2016-2161	20			2017-07-27	2018-04-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, malicious input to mod_auth_digest can cause the server to crash, and each instance continues to crash even for subsequently valid requests.
33	CVE-2016-1546	399		DoS	2016-07-06	2018-06-02	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 and 2.4.18, when mod_http2 is enabled, does not limit the number of simultaneous stream workers for a single HTTP/2 connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stream-processing outage) via modified flow-control windows.
34	CVE-2016-0736	310			2017-07-27	2018-04-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.
35	CVE-2015-3185	264		Bypass	2015-07-20	2018-01-04	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated with an authorization setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.
36	CVE-2015-3183	20			2015-07-20	2018-01-04	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	Partial	None	The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.14 does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension characters in modules/http/http_filters.c.
37	CVE-2015-0253			DoS	2015-07-20	2018-01-04	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The read_request_line function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.12 does not initialize the protocol structure member, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and process crash) by sending a request that lacks a method to an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter and has an ErrorDocument 400 directive specifying a local URI.
38	CVE-2015-0228	20		DoS	2015-03-07	2018-10-30	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The lua_websocket_read function in lua_request.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (child-process crash) by sending a crafted WebSocket Ping frame after a Lua script has called the wsupgrade function.
39	CVE-2014-8109	264		Bypass	2014-12-29	2016-12-30	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization for one group to access a certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a second directory.
40	CVE-2014-3583	119		DoS Overflow	2014-12-15	2017-10-02	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The handle_headers function in mod_proxy_fcgi.c in the mod_proxy_fcgi module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.10 allows remote FastCGI servers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and daemon crash) via long response headers.
41	CVE-2014-3523	399		DoS	2014-07-20	2018-01-04	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	Memory leak in the winnt_accept function in server/mpm/winnt/child.c in the WinNT MPM in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.10 on Windows, when the default AcceptFilter is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted requests.
42	CVE-2014-0231	399		DoS	2014-07-20	2018-10-30	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Partial	The mod_cgid module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10 does not have a timeout mechanism, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process hang) via a request to a CGI script that does not read from its stdin file descriptor.
43	CVE-2014-0226	362	1	DoS Exec Code Overflow +Info	2014-07-20	2017-12-08	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Race condition in the mod_status module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow), or possibly obtain sensitive credential information or execute arbitrary code, via a crafted request that triggers improper scoreboard handling within the status_handler function in modules/generators/mod_status.c and the lua_ap_scoreboard_worker function in modules/lua/lua_request.c.
44	CVE-2014-0118	399		DoS	2014-07-20	2017-12-08	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	The deflate_in_filter function in mod_deflate.c in the mod_deflate module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10, when request body decompression is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much larger size.
